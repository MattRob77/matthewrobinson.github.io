 		The actual gallery function is powered by my Poptrox plugin. For info on
 		how that works, go here: github.com/ajlkn/jquery.poptrox

		Each image (the '...' bit in the above examples) should look like this:

			<article class="from-(direction)">
				<a href="path/to/fullsize.jpg" class="image fit">
					<img src="path/to/thumbnail.jpg" title="This is the image caption." alt="" />
				</a>
			</article>

		The "from-(direction)" class indicates the direction from which the image should
		slide into view, and can be any of the following:

			from-left
			from-right
			from-bottom
			from-left

		You can also just remove the "from-(direction)" class if you don't want that particular
		image to slide into view (in which case it'll simply fade in).
